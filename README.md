## Notes

Making the gif was the hardest part here as I am a MAC USER I had to screen record and then have to trim the video then convert the .mov file into .gif file. Finally, by using Imgur create a link in to add. Adding the UI Button and make it into action was a little bit difficult and I also added the features of bg text with 3 label with each different text size.
